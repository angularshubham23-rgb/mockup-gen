- Build and run tests locally (see README for running server/client tests).

Branching & commits
- Please use descriptive commits and follow conventional commits when possible.
- Open a pull request against `main` and include a short description of the change and rationale.

Code review
- All PRs should have at least one reviewer (CODEOWNERS will suggest reviewers).
- CI should pass before merging.
